#This is a CV example for HTML5-CCS3-JS module of III Web Bootcamp.

# Edge supports calc() if you use "margin-right: calc(-50vw + 50%);" when you don´t want margins even if your element has a max-width. But doesn´t work when you calculate the columns of the grid. I don´t know why. I decided not to use in any case and solved the problem of margins eliminating max-width (actually, I don´t use ".container" properties).

# I couldn´t use var() either because Edge doesn´t support that.
